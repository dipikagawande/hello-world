# hello-world
This is my first repository! Here to learn. R scripts will be predominant. Python in the future. 
The aim here is quantity -- iteration and experimentation to gain skill and confidence. Committed to learning stats, machine learning, and data visualization. My data science problem sets as well as Kaggle kernels will be uploaded here.
