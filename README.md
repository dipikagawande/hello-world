# hello-world
This is my first repository! Here to learn. R scripts will be predominant. Python as I gain ability and confidence. 
The aim here is quantity -- iteration and experimentation. Committed to learning stats, machine learning, and data visualization. My data science course problem sets as well as Kaggle kernels will be uploaded here.
